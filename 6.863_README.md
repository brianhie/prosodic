# Instructions for running parsing code:

**The parsing code requires Python 2.7.** All other requirements should already be supplied within this directory.

To parse the lines of poetry with the different configuration sets, simply run the command:

```
python parse_lines.py
```

To get accuracy measurements of the individual meters and the two ensemble meters, run the command:

```
python accuracy.py
```

This will print the accuracy percentages to the terminal in order of iambic, trochaic, anapestic, and dactylic.
